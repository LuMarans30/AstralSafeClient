A .NET MAUI application that encrypts and decrypts an exe file for anti-piracy demonstration.

To run the application, you must first run the server ([AstralSafeServer repo](https://github.com/LuMarans30/AstralSafeServer)).

The program encrypts and decrypts a file called main.exe, which is located in the Resources/Raw folder of the project.
